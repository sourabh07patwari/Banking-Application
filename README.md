# Banking-Application
The objective of this project was to simulate a banking application.
This system can read account information from a file, and create account objects with the contained specifications.
This system prompts the user with a menu with available actions. 
Upon closing, the banking application will write all updated information to the original file. The database was stored in the local file system in .csv format.
Made use of Object Oriented Principle concepts like encapsulation for hiding the actual data from the accessing system and separation of concerns for decomposing the problem statement into modular components.
